# PROJECT NAME
 
 **Cloud SOC Lab for Advanced Security: Threat Detection and Response with SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel) Implementation**.
 
 ## Objective
  TThis project is to design, implement, and showcase a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) lab in the cloud. This SOC lab will leverage Microsoft Sentinel to provide advanced threat detection, real-time monitoring, and automated response capabilities. The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in setting up a cloud-based SOC environment, integrating various data sources, implementing Analytic rules for threat detection, workbook for threat visualization, Threat Intelligence Integration such as threat feed  and watch lists to track and monitor indicators of compromise (IOCs) and automating incident response workflows with Logic Apps.

  ## Skills Learned
  - Cloud Infrastructure Setup: Proficiency in deploying and configuring virtual machines, storage accounts, and network security groups in Azure. Ability to manage and organize cloud resources effectively using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and Azure portal.
  - SIEM Implementation:Expertise in setting up Microsoft Sentinel in a Log Analytics workspace. Integration of multiple data sources (e.g., Azure Activity Logs, SecurityEvent, network logs, storage logs) into Microsoft Sentinel for centralized monitoring.
  - KQL: Use of Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query, analyze, and visualize security logs and events.
  - Security Monitoring and Incident Management: Continuous monitoring of security alerts and incidents in Microsoft Sentinel and the Use of Sentinel's investigation tools to analyze and respond to security incidents.
    

  ### Tools Used For this Project
- Microsoft Visio for diagram mapping.
- Azure Portal: To manage and configure Azure resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks, NSGs, Storage Account.
- Microsoft Sentinel: The primary SIEM solution for log collection, analysis, threat detection, and incident response. Watchlist, Analytic Rules, Azure Logic Apps were explored.
- Log Analytics Workspace: For collecting and analyzing log data from various sources.
- Kusto Query Language (KQL): To query, analyze, and visualize log data in the Log.
- Powershell: To ping Virtual machine.
- Diagnostic Settings: To configure and send logs from Azure resources to the Log Analytics workspace.
